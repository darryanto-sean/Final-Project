            Hi, I’m Sean!</br> 
            I’m a computer science major at Santa Monica College with hopes of transferring to UW-Seattle. I primarily write in Java, but I’m learning Node.js because I'd like to work more alongside the back-end aspect of software. I took an Advanced Java course in my senior year of high school and immediately fell in love with coding. That summer I made my own version of Flappy Bird with Objective-C by learning independently online. My first semester of college I participated at HackCC and learned basic Python and PHP to create an appservice for the application Yo. I picked up HTML and CSS while on winter break of 2015 and learned Javascript in the summer. I hope you learn a little more about me from my site!

            In my last year of high school I was lucky enough to take a Java Programming course
            and I loved the concept of coding because each problem I faced felt like a puzzle that 
            I had to piece together. I enjoyed finding the pieces that came together to make the 
            solution of a problem. I became bored with the standard AP projects assigned to us, so I also
            worked on ProjectEuler problems to introduce myself to algorithms and problem-solving.

            During the summer, I learned Objective-C on my ownthrough online tutorials, 
            and developed my first application: Flappy Sean, a Flappy Bird-inspired iPhone 
            game. At this point, I was addicted to coding, but frustrated at the lack of 
            opportunity to learn more than what the Internet had to offer. In the Fall of 2015,
            then took a iOS Development class at SMC where I learned more in-depth content on Swift.

            I dropped my winter calculus course because of personal issues in the beginning of 2015, 
            but I still felt disappointed in myself because I have high expectations of myself as a 
            student. Eager to fill those expectations, I took the initiative to learn front-end
            development as a personal project. Through watching online UC Berkeley lectures I learned 
            HTML/CSS to make a website for mother's day to show how much I appreciated her, and this!

            In 2015 I decided that I would try to learn two coding languages, and read two textbooks 
            to help further my progress with Computer Science. The two languages I chose were Ruby on Rails, 
            and Javascript (specifically for Node.js). I took it upon myself to buy Javascript textbooks and 
            study them independently while taking other courses at school. I've used Javascript for the development
            of this website, and plan on tackling more in-depth Node.js soon.

            In the fall of my first year at Santa Monica College, I formed a team with another student to participate in the first HackCC: a hackathon tailored for Southern California community college students. Coming into the event, the only CS languages I knew were Java from the high school course and Objective-C, but throughout the hackathon, I learned so much more about Java and Python. While at HackCC, I worked on an application service for the application Yo, a one-click communication application. My service allowed the user to send a ‘Yo’ to a WellsFargoFinder which collected the location to open a yelp page of the nearest Wells Fargo.

            In the Spring, I joined a team at the AT&T: Hack to the Future to develop a piece of hardware aptly named Swych. The theme of the hackathon was to further the development of the Internet of Things, which is seen in the general trend of smart appliances that interact with users, and Swych did just that. It was a product that allowed users to check the status of various appliances that were connected to Swych and switch the power status of each individually. What was innovative about Swych was that it turned ordinary appliances into “smart” appliances, and did not require a phone with Internet capabilities. My team consisted of 4 programmers and 1 electrical engineer. Our electrical engineer developed the hardware behind Swych, primarily using Intel’s Edison board. I was in charge of programming the code for the client to server communication with Node.js We won first place in that hackathon.

            In my second year of college I became the website coordinator for Alpha Gamma Sigma, an Honors Society at Santa Monica College. I was reached out by a friend to help create, maintain and host the website for the club because the coordinator at the time would be transferring after that semester. I decided to take the position as website coordinator and stayed for the entire year. Since first taking on the position, I completely revamped the website so that members and volunteer organizations could interact with the executive board with an easier and more aesthetically pleasing interface. SMC is the only chapter in California with a website created by an executive board member.

            At the end beginning of my last semester at Santa Monica College, my coworkers from the Computer Science Lab at school and I participated at the ATT Hack in Irvine, CA. We created an application called Tutr that allowed students to search for tutors in their area similar to the service that Uber provides. It was a project that we were all interested in considering few of us had any real experience with the coding required to bring the product to life. My friend Bilguun and I were in charge of the back-end programming which involved creating and setting up the webserver, to networking the client to the server. With only 24 hours, we were able to complete the front-end and back-end, but ran out of time before connecting the server to the client. Although the project ended with failure, I gained an immeasurable amouont of experience with back-end that I seeked so fervently.
